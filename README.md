## General

This repository holds the source code for our WebAuthn Autocomplete / Passkey Autofill Playground. It should help
developers test and understand different device, operating system and browser behavior when it comes to developing
passkey-based / WebAuthn-based applications.

We kept the design minimalistic, so that you can experience the autocomplete / autofill features without any
distractions.

You can find the live playground here: https://webauthn-autocomplete.vercel.app
